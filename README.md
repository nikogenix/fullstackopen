My submissions for Full Stack Open 2022

## About

The projects were bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In each project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

For projects with a DB, such as the Phonebook project, you will have to start the DB server first:

`npm run server`

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
